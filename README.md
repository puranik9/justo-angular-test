# Angular Test for Justo

The coding challenge was completed using JavaScript with Angular, HTML, & CSS. I have provided instructions below and if you have any issues, please contact me at puranikkartik@gmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Objective

Create a basic Angular application which lets a user hit a button to pull in a set of posts from this fake API( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ ) 
The API call should populate the page with a list of posts, and the user should be search the current list, alongside being able to click on any of them to open up a larger view.

## Instructions to run program

1. Clone or Download (.zip) this repository
2. In your terminal, cd into the `mobilelive-assessment` directory
3. If you don't have npm installed, please do so here: `https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm`
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `ng serve`
6. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` in your favorite browser
7. Hit the `Get Posts` button to fetch the API data and simply wait to see the posts on your screen
8. Hit the `Reset` button to start over
9. Enjoy!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help
